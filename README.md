Healthcare Staff Scheduling Optimization
Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing staff schedules at CUF Tejo, a leading healthcare provider in Portugal. Utilizing linear programming techniques with Python's PuLP library, we aimed to minimize staffing costs while ensuring regulatory compliance and coverage.
Objectives
	•	Develop a linear programming model for efficient staff allocation.
	•	Minimize staffing costs and optimize coverage across departments.
	•	Address scheduling challenges within healthcare settings.
Technologies Used
	•	Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
	•	PuLP: A linear programming library used for optimization.
	•	Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation.
	•	Excel: For initial data processing and analysis.
Features
	•	Custom optimization model to handle complex scheduling requirements.
	•	Data-driven approach to identify optimal staff allocation.
	•	Sensitivity and scenario analysis to evaluate model robustness.
Challenges and Solutions
	•	Simplification of complex scheduling issues to fit computational constraints.
	•	Balancing cost reduction with quality of care and staff satisfaction.
Results
Achieved significant improvements in staffing efficiency, reducing operational costs while maintaining high levels of service quality.
Usage
This repository contains all the code and documentation for setting up and running the optimization model. Follow the instructions in the docs folder to replicate the model or adapt it to your needs.
Contribution
This project is the result of a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing operational efficiency in healthcare. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to further improve the model.
